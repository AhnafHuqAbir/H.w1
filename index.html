    <!--History of AI-->
    In his 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," Alan Turing <br>considered whether machines could think.
    In this
    <br>paper, Turing first coined the term artificial intelligence and <br>presented it as a theoretical and
    philosophical concept.
    <br>However, AI, as we know it today, is the result of the collective <br>effort of many scientists and engineers
    over several
    <br>decades.
